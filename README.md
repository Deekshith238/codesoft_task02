💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a publicly available dataset, we apply various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

📁 Dataset
We use a dataset containing transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of transactions labeled as fraudulent.

Features: 30 numerical features (V1 to V28, Time, Amount)

Label: Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)

Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

🧠 Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Each model is trained and evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC due to the class imbalance.

🔍 Evaluation Metrics
Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we focus on:

Precision: How many predicted frauds were actually frauds?

Recall: How many actual frauds were detected?

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

ROC-AUC: Overall ability of the model to discriminate between classes
